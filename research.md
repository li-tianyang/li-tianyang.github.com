# Bioinformatics 

I am currently doing bioinformatics research at [Dr. Xuegong Zhang](http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/member/xzhang/XZhang_English.htm)'s [lab](http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/enarticle/index.html). 

Projects that I'm currently working on:

* [Bayesian de novo transcript reconstruction and abundance estimation from RNA-Seq data](https://github.com/tianyang-li/de-novo-rna-seq-quant-1)

* [Statistical etimation a transcript's length from RNA-Seq data](https://github.com/tianyang-li/rna-seq-len-est-0)

* [Assembly Assisted RNA-Seq Alignment](https://github.com/tianyang-li/aarsa)
